## Introduction
This capstone project includes the software written in **Python** that **plans a trajectory for the end-effector of youBot mobile manipulator (a mobile base with four mecanum wheels and a 5R robot arm), performs odometry as the chassis moves, and performs feedback control to drive the youBot to pick up a block at a specific location, carry it to a desired location, and put it down**. The software written for this project creates comma-separated values (csv) text file that specifies the configurations of the chassis and the arm, the angles of the four wheels and the state of the gripper as a function of time. This csv file will then be simulated in V-REP as shown in the video below.  
One can find the detailed assignment of the project [here](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Mobile_Manipulation_Capstone).
