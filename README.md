## Introduction
This capstone project includes the software written in **Python** that **plans a trajectory for the end-effector of youBot mobile manipulator (a mobile base with four mecanum wheels and a 5R robot arm), performs odometry as the chassis moves, and performs feedback control to drive the youBot to pick up a block at a specific location, carry it to a desired location, and put it down**. The software written for this project creates comma-separated values (csv) text file that specifies the configurations of the chassis and the arm, the angles of the four wheels and the state of the gripper as a function of time. This csv file will then be simulated in V-REP as shown in the video below.  
One can find the detailed assignment of the project [here](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Mobile_Manipulation_Capstone).

## Video demonstration
Two videos below respectively show the result of the simulation with and without the feedback control.

## Software
The project is broken down to 3 different functions and one main script.  

1. `trajGenerator.py`: Creates the reference trajectory planned based on the initial and target position of the end-effector. Midway stop/standoff positions are set to be 0.1m above the target object.  
  
2. `nextState.py`: Generates the 12-vector of robot configuration after the given time step(set to be 0.01s) given the current position.  
  
3. `feedbackControl.py`: Takes the current actual configuration of the end-effector and performs the feedback control with respect to reference trajectory with given proportional and integral gain.  
  
4. `fullProgram.py`: Runs the entire program accepting user input for initial position, initial and final object position to generate comma-separate-values file.

As the Mobile Manipulation Capstone project was made public in Coursera course of Monder Robotics, I am not sharing the source code for the project here but please feel free to reach out to me at jamessohn2019@u.northwestern or through my [Portfolio](http://sohn21c.github.io) to see them.

## Result
The program successfully fulfills all of the given tasks including, but not limited to, generating reference trajectory, performs odometry and implement the feedback control. Shown below is the plot generated by the Python script showing the configuration error between the reference to actual whe initial error was given to the system intentionally. As one can see, control loop properly works and eliminates the error.
